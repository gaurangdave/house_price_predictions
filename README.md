# House Price Prediction

## Problem Statement

- Use California census data to build a model of housing prices in the state.
- This data includes metrics such as the population, median income, and median housing price for each block group in California.
- Block groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).
- Currently district house prices are estimated manually by experts who gather the up-to-date information about to either get the median housing price or estimate it using complex rules.
  - The current process is costly and time-consuming and estimates are off by more than 30%
- We need a ML model to **predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.**
- The modelâ€™s output will be fed to another ML system along with other signals to determine whether it is worth investing in a given area.

## Solution Details

- The solution needs to predict the housing price so this is going to be a regression task and since we have labeled dataset, we can use supervised learning algorithms.
  - Specifically its a `multiple regression problem` since weâ€™ll use multiple features to make a prediction.
  - And since target is a single value its going to be `univariate regression` problem.
- We donâ€™t expect the housing prices or the related matrices to change that often, so a `batch learning` approach should suffice.
  - The data is small enough to fit in memory so plain batch learning should be fine.

### Performance Measure

- We are going to use the `Root mean square error (RMSE)` to measure the performance.
- The mathematical formula for `RMSE` is

$$
RMSE(X,h) = \sqrt{{1 \over m} \sum_{i=1}^m(h(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2}
$$

- Here,
  - $m$ is the number of instances in the dataset we are measuring `RMSE` on.
  - $x^{(i)}$ is the vector of all the feature values of the $i^{th}$ instance in the dataset and $y^{(i)}$ is its label.
  - $X$ is the matrix containing all the feature values (excluding the labels) of all the instances in the dataset.
  - $h$ is the systemâ€™s prediction function, also called `hypothesis`.
    - When the prediction function receives feature vector $x^{(i)}$ as input it outputs the predicted value $\hat{y}^{(i)}$

$$
    \hat{y}^{(i)} = h(x^{(i)})
$$
